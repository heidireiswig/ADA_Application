/*
Farmers Market Assessment using SQL Express. 
Analyze data throughout USA using annual report. 
Exclude all markets located w/in a city w/more-than-one word in its name.
Use data in file to answer Q's & explain techniques used to arrive at each answer.

Q's: 
1. How many markets sell vegetables, but not anything sweet?
2. What state has the highest density of famers market per capita? What state has the lowest?
3. How many US farmers markets are between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi river?
4. What is one fact or pattern about farmers markets in the United States that you can recognize using the raw data?
*/

/* techniques used to arrive at each answer for answer number 1:

First I research/downloaded SQL, then I covereted csv file to excell.
Then I created a new query and imported the excel doc. lots of online tutorials to get me here.

Now I will create a query based on the imported information to answer the questions. I found Queryâ€™s design query in 
editor and used that to pars the information out. Yeah. Next I read about filter conditions, characters and wild card 
character. This helped me sort the list to get the answers.

/* Question 1 Answer: 356 Markets sell vegetables but not anything sweet, 
unless Bakedgoods are sweet then it could be less then 356. */

/* here is how I got the answer and you should be able to copy and paste this into SQL to see the answer*/

SELECT city, MarketName, Vegetables, Honey, Jams, Maple, Bakedgoods
FROM  ['farmers-markets']
WHERE [city] not like '% %' 
and [Vegetables]like 'Y' and [Honey] like 'N' 
and [Jams] like 'N' and [Maple] like 'N' 

/*Question 2 Answer:  California has the highest density of farmers market per capita (759).   
Virgin Islands is not a state but they do have the lowest number in the database (4). 
So the next one would be Delaware with 29. 
There are three states that have spelling errors that cause the data to be skeded Virigina & Virginia (total of 246), 
Miinesota & Minnesota (total 186), and California and Calafornia (total of 759). 
*/

/* here is how I got the answer and you should be able to copy and paste this into SQL to see the answer*/

SELECT State,Count([state])AS markets
FROM  ['farmers-markets']
GROUP BY State 
ORDER BY State DESC

/*The above code asks SQL to pull the State information and count how many times it sees the same State and then 
lable the catigory markets. It pulls from the farmers market database and groups together all the same State then it
lists the data of State in Decscending order. 

Techniques used to arrive at each answer:

I had first ordered by markets in desc order so i could see the total of each State.
Then i switched to state so i could see the duplicates. My journey getting here was long with lots of tutorials on line. 
Also I looked at the excel spreadsheet so i could get my barrings on how to ask the correct question on line. I used my 
notebook to track each code I tried and each question that I broke down. I wanted to go down a rabit hole and generate the 
perfect answer in SQL. I wanted to find a way to merge the states information that was spelled incorrectly and then redo 
the list. For me it would be faster if I were to update the Excel sheet and then re-import the excel doc. I did not do this 
because I am trying to learn how to do it in SQL. However, since I know I have the right answers i will move on and maybe 
come back to this later to perfect it. 

Some of my questions that lead me here were: 

How many of row B have the same State name?
Find rows that have the same value!
how do I have it tell me who is the max and who is the min to confirm the results I got above?
how do i merge two columns of database in SQL express
wait: how do I combine the data in two columns into one column.

*/Question 3 Answer:

Techniques used to arrive at each answer:
Q3: How many US farmers markets are between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi river?
First I ask the questions: 
Longitued and lattitude question 
What are the Rocky mountains? 
What is there long/lat? A: The absolute is: 43.7400 degrees North, 110.8000 degrees West. 
What is the long/lat of Mississippi Rvr? A: The absolute is: 29.1536 degrees North, 89.2508 degrees West
How many farmers-markets are between RM 43.7400N,110.800W and MR 29.1536N, 89.2508W? 
What code in SQL Express will show me how many farmers markets are between RM/LL and MR/LL? 
asked the internet: how do i write a code in sql express to find everything in between longitude and latitude of two points?
here is where i admit I am in the process of refressing my math skills. change q' to 
SQL Query for Performing Radius Search based on Latitude Longitude - sounds much closer to what I need.
